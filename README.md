# Citi Bike Cruisin'

## Purpose
Let's go for a ride!

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the Citibike program in New York city during the month of August and determine if a similar program could be successful if incorporated in Des Moines, IA.

Please see my results section below for a breakdown of my findings along with Tableau visualizations. 


## Results 

### Trips by Weekday

By looking at the data, we can see that most bikes are checked out between 7 to 9 am, and 5 to 7 pm on the weekdays (Monday through Friday). I would say these times represent a New Yorkers daily commute to and from work. This trend is also present when we look at the demand per hour in the month of August, with the highest number of trips being between 5 to 6 pm.

There is also consistent usage during the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) between the hours 10 am to 6 pm, which could be because of tourist visiting the city on the weekends. The weekend hours do not have the same demand in specific hours of the day compared to the weekdays, but the trips are more spread out amongst the day. I wanted to see what the total of trips per Weekday was, and found that Sunday and Wednesday have the lowest number of trips, and Thursday through Saturday have the highest number. Thursday has the highest number of trips of any weekday and I would attribute this to both commuter/locals as well as tourists seeing this is a popular travel destination. Below is a breakdown of "Total Trips by Weekday" and" Total Trips by Weekday Per Hour":

### Trips by Gender

These visualizations gives a breakdown of riders by gender throughout the week. We can see that the bike sharing program is highly dominated by male users with the majority of users being Subscribers.

### Bike Utilization

When drilling down on trip duration, the data tells us that people are only using bikes on average less than an hour at a given time with the majority of trips being betweek 5-10 minutes long. This visualization also emphasizes that my previous point of males being the dominat users.

## Summary
First and foremost - the biggest notifiable trend this data tells us is that there are significantly more male users than female users. It is also clear that peak usages occuring during rush hour during the work week which means we can predict that Citibikes are a popular form of transpoertation for commuting to work. 

Additional visualizations I would like to see include - 'Trips by Age by Hour and by Week'. By having these visualization I could help determine if there are different age groups that are active during the day/week. I would also be interested in the geographical elements of Des Moines, IA and how long it may take to ride a bike from different attractions or office disctricts in the city. Since most trips lasted around 10 minutes, the program may not be as successful if the point of interst in Des Moines are spread out further than this time threshold.

Overall, based on my assumptions given in my visualizations I believe a Citibike program would be a popular and successful invesment for the city of Des Moines.
