# Citi Bike Cruisin'

## Purpose
Let's go for a ride!

The purpose of this analysis is to show how successful the Citi Bike bike sharing service is in New York City during the month of August. I'll use this analysis to determine if a similar program should be incorporated in Des Moines, IA.

I have included some screenshots of my data analysis, as well as provided a link to show all of my anlaysis in the Results section.


## Results 

### Trips by Weekday

By looking at the data, we can see that most bikes are checked out between 7 to 9 am, and 5 to 7 pm on the weekdays (Monday through Friday). I would say these times represent a New Yorkers daily commute to and from work. This trend is also present when we look at the demand per hour in the month of August, with the highest number of trips being between 5 to 6 pm.

There is also consistent usage during the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) between the hours 10 am to 6 pm, which could be because of tourist visiting the city on the weekends. The weekend hours do not have the same demand in specific hours of the day compared to the weekdays, but the trips are more spread out amongst the day. I wanted to see what the total of trips per Weekday was, and found that Sunday and Wednesday have the lowest number of trips, and Thursday through Saturday have the highest number. Thursday has the highest number of trips of any weekday and I would attribute this to having both commuters utilizing the bikes as well as tourist that fly in for a long weekend. Below is a breakdown of "Total Trips by Weekday" and" Total Trips by Weekday Per Hour":

### Trips by Gender

These visualizations gives a breakdown of riders by gender throughout the week. We can see that the bike sharing program is highly dominated by male users with the majority of users being Subscribers.

### Bike Utilization
[*click here to see full breakdown of trip duration*](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.gerrard/viz/NYCCitibikeChallenge_16239752632880/Weekdays)

When drilling down on trip duration, the data tells us that people are only using bikes on average less than an hour at a given time with the majority of trips being betweek 5-10 minutes long. 





### Top Starting Locations
Shows that the top locations are concentrated in a central part of NYC (lower Manhattan), with small usage in the surrounding areas.









### Trips by Weekday by Hour
Shows that early morning is a very busy time between 6-9am during the work week, and 5-6pm during the work week. During the weekends, trips are more evenly spread out.
### Checkout times by Gender
Shows make users more active in the early hours of the day, with both female and male users peaking between 4-6am. We have more male users (by a wide margin) in our data.
### User Trips By Gender By Weekday
Shows that our subscribers are most active, with both male and female users taking the most trips during the work week. For both genders we see a drop off mid-week on Wednesdays, which may need to be explored further.
### Trips by Gender by Hour
Shows early morning peaks for both female and male users (with the busiest time being 8am), and in the afternoon between 5-6 pm. On Saturday's we see usage spread out more, and significantly lower trips on Sunday than Saturday.

## Summary
Overall we have significantly more male than female users, with peak usages occuring during the work week. Peak usage also occurs during the morning and evening "rush hour" when people are likely commuting to work.

Additional visualizations that could be created include Trips by Age by Hour and by Week. to help determine if there are different age groups that are active during the day/week, which may impact the marketing of the business. In addition, Trip distance by gender vs. trip duration by gender to determine which users are travelling further and keep the bikes longer.

## Summary
Based on the data, it appears that the bike sharing program is very successful and widely used in New York City. Some things for future consideration would be to look at gender and geographical data for Des Moines, IA, as well as how many tourists the city gets.

In order for this to be successful in another location, you would want to consider what percentage of the population is male, since the program is widely used by male subscribers and customers. I would also be interested in the geographical elements of Des Moines, IA and how long it may take to ride a bike from different attractions or office disctricts in the city. Since most trips lasted around 10 minutes, the program may not be as successful if the point of interst in Des Moines are spread out further than this time threshold. I would also like more information regarding customer vs. subscriber? Does a subscriber mean they have an annual, weekly, or daily membership to use the bikes? Are subscribers only local users? Are customers considered tourists and just using the bikes once while on vacation? It would be beneficial to understand this a little better to see if you wanted to look at tourism in Des Moines, or just focus on the permenant population of the city.

Overall, I think the bike sharing program would be popular and worth the investment.
